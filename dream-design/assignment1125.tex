\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
Smartwatches promise to bring enhanced convenience to
common communication, creation and information retrieval
tasks. Due to their prominent placement on the wrist, they
must be small and otherwise unobtrusive, which limits the
sophistication of interactions we can perform. This problem
is particularly acute if the smartwatch relies on a
touchscreen for input, as the display is small and our fingers
are relatively large. In this work, we propose a complementary
input approach: using the watch face as a multi-degreeof-freedom,
mechanical interface. We developed a proof of
concept smartwatch that supports continuous 2D panning
and twist, as well as binary tilt and click. To illustrate the
potential of our approach, we developed a series of example
applications, many of which are cumbersome – or even impossible
– on today’s smartwatch devices.

The wristwatch has been an ever-present wearable technology
since its inception in the early 1900s, and has undergone
continuous technical refinement since that time. Researchers
have long viewed the immediacy and ubiquity of
the wristwatch as a vehicle for computation, pushing its capabilities
to ever-greater heights. In 2000, IBM demonstrated
the first watch running a full operating system [20].
However, unlike smartphones, which can be scaled to a variety
of sizes, smartwatches must be small and unobtrusive
in order to remain socially acceptable, which has long limited
their practicality.

Recently, smartwatches have experienced a resurgence of
interest as electronics have become more powerful and
power efficient, making them more practical and capable
than ever before. Products like the Pebble smartwatch have
been popularized in the public press, and prominent manufacturers
such as Qualcomm, Sony, Motorola and Samsung.

n-air gestures can utilize area around the watch for input
with minimal screen occlusion. For example, the Gesture
Watch [8] and HoverFlow [9] used IR proximity sensors to
capture gestures performed above a device. Ni and Baudisch
[15] used a tiny, wrist-worn, high-resolution optical
sensor to recognize gestures performed on top of it. Abracadabra
[4] used free-space magnetic tracking to sense an instrumented
finger near a wrist-worn device. However, these
gesture-based techniques require specific clutching mechanisms,
lack tactile feedback, and are generally indiscreet.
Our approach hopes to mitigate these issues by providing
users a physical, direct manipulation interface.

The approach we present complements contemporary smartwatch
input mechanisms, namely touch, physical buttons
and voice. Our approach does not hinder any of latter modalities,
while simultaneously enabling new dimensions of
input, which we view as a significant benefit. That being
said, there are several drawbacks and limitations that should
also be noted, which we now describe.

As with capacitive touch, buttons and voice, there is a danger
of accidental input. This might occur by snagging on
clothing or being “pushed” when e.g., the hands are resting
on a table. Like other modalities, an “unlock” mechanism
might have to be employed to reduce false activations. Indeed,
a device could have one such mechanism shared by
all input modalities. 

In this work, we designed and implemented a new smartwatch
interaction modality that uses the watch face as a
multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical interface, enabling users
to pan, zoom, navigate, select and perform other actions
using simple physical controls. We demonstrated these capabilities
with a suite of example applications, built around
five interaction techniques. Our approach is inexpensive,
potentially compact, and can complement existing inputs,
such as physical buttons, touch and voice.

The popularity of smartwatches has increased rapidly in
the last year. Smartwatches are being hailed as a new
disruptive technology that might bring wearable
computing to the masses. As smart watches are
normally worn on the wrist, we see a big potential for
them to digitally augmented gestures performed in
day-to-day contexts. 

In this paper, we describe the
design and development of an application for a
smartwatch to assist office employees in easily locking
and unlocking doors, in acquiring room information and
notifying others when they want to enter their office. 

 Because of the
small screen we wanted to make the interaction fast.
We decided to implement three types of physical
gestures to support the most important functionalities.
First, we provide the opportunity to perform a virtual
knock with the same gesture as a real knock. Secondly,
we support opening/closing doors using the gesture of
turning your wrist, just like turning a key to open a
door. Finally, the last gesture we provide is swiping
your arm to bring you back to the home screen with
room scanning functionality.

Knowledge workers tend to drop by each other’s offices
regularly, for example, to ask for assistance or quickly
discuss something. Even with the door open, knocking
on the door is a common gesture to politely indicate
your presence and check whether you are not
interrupting the person. Using smartwatches, we could
digitally augment these gestures, which can provide a
number of benefits. For example, when a person is not
in his office, knock gestures could still be recognized
and transferred to that person’s smartwatch. This
allows office workers to keep a record of who came by
and who they might have missed. Additionally, it is
often annoying to interrupt a phone or Skype call to tell
the person knocking on the door that now is not a good
time. Depending on who is knocking on the door, it
might be important enough to interrupt the phone call.
Using our smartwatch applications, the person in the
call gets a notification about the virtual knock, and can
choose to deny their colleague access or let them in,
without having to interrupt the call. 

Keys (or keycards) are commonly used to open doors in
office buildings. However, they also have several
disadvantages: generic keys could still provide access
to restricted rooms; they might be lost or forgotten
(e.g. people could lock themselves out); or people
might forget to lock the door, which could lead to theft
of personal belongings or sensitive information. Our
Office Smartwatch application tracks the identity of its
users to provide more fine-grained access control.
Using the user’s identity, we can restrict access only to
the doors that they are allowed to open. Users do not
have to remember to bring their keys, assuming they
always have their smartwatch on their wrist. To prevent
theft, doors could be automatically locked after a
specific period of time and door entry and exit could be
logged.

In our application, we have three kinds of feedback:
visual feedback on the smartwatch display, audio
feedback (e.g., a knocking sound when performing a
virtual knock) and vibration in case of a notification.
Also for smartwatches, visual feedback remains the
most common way of providing feedback to users. In
order to keep the display contents easy to grasp, we
only show information that is essential, following the
recommendations of Kärkkäinen and Laarni [8]

 However, when the user looked
at the screen, he only got feedback of the last gesture
that was performed. To address this problem, we
decided to add audio feedback and play a sound every
time a gesture has been detected. Users should be able
to immediately distinguish the performed gesture based
on the sound they hear. For example, when a virtual
knock gesture is performed, the device plays a real
knocking sound. For the opening/closing gesture we
decided to use a rattling keys sound. For going back to
the scan functionality, we use a sibilant whoosh sound

 Vibrations are only used
sparingly, as they can be annoying to the user.
Vibrations are only used for notifications: for notifying
the user when someone is knocking on their door, when
they need to attend a meeting, in case of an error, or
when the user tries to perform an action without the
right permissions (e.g. opening the boss’s office door). 

Smartwatches now provide users with access to many
applications on smartphones direct from their wrists,
without the need to touch their smartphone. While
applications such as email, messaging, calendar and
social networking provide views on the watch, there is
normally no text entry method so users cannot reply on
the same device. Here we introduce requirements for
smartwatch text entry, an optimised alphabetic layout
and present a prototype implementation together with
preliminary user feedback. While raising some problems,
the feedback gives indicates that reasonable quality and
speed is achievable on a smartwatch and encourages our
future work.

Before the widespread adoption of touch screen
smartphones, 12-key physical keypad phones were the
most common text entry method on small devices
(sometimes much smaller than the current relatively
large screen phones). Predictive technologies (e.g. [4,
10, 11]) interpreted the ambiguous keys (usually three
or four letters per key) into words. This approach was
shown to achieve around 10 words per minute (wpm) for
novices and around 20-25 wpm for experts in controlled
studies [12]. We investigated using this approach with
reduced number of keys - initially targeting watches [3],
but due to technological restrictions our system was
implemented on a touchscreen handheld, and later, to
reduce movement, on physical key phones [6]. While in
theory ambiguous predictive text quality was very high
(over 90% accurate), each key sequence could match
many different words. Some of these sequences included
pairs of common words that caused particular problems
(e.g. on a standard phone keypad he and if were typed
on the same keys, as were good and home). The early
models of prediction were based on simple unigram
dictionary models where the most common word
matching a sequence was suggested. Nowadays, phones
have much more power and memory so can easily
support more complex prediction models, which greatly
reduces the impact of ambiguity by taking the context of
the words into account.

One system of particular note is ZoomBoard [17] that
miniaturises the QWERTY keyboard onto a watch, with
the user first zooming into an area then picking a letter.
ZoomBoard achieved approx. 10wpm in studies and our
work is essentially investigating whether predictive
based approaches can surpass this using single taps per
letter. Many domestic appliances such as TV guides and
games consoles use a date-stamp inspired method,
where the user scrolls through the alphabet and picks
letters on a 2D line or 3D grid. In their early work on
small device text entry Bellman and MacKenzie [1]
showed this to be a slow entry method that was not
particularly helped by dynamic optimisation. 

Speech input is an obvious alternative but is still prone
to problems with background noise, spoken accents and
is less private and discrete than typing.  

Interaction was defined as follows:

1. A tap on an ambiguous key enters that key number and updates the current word display to reflect the most likely word from the disambiguation engine based on the current number-key sequence. 

2. A first tap on the cental zone adds a space, with subsequent taps rotating round alternative suggestions that match the ambiguous entry. 

3. Swipes are defined as shown in table 1. In punctuation and numeric modes the zones 1...6 are replaced with alternative layouts. Where available, a rightwards swipe gesture can be used for word completion. 

4. A long press on the centre zone enters edit mode to allow movement of the caret while a long press on the alphabetic keys will show extended characters for that key (e.g. )

As documented by Everett Rodgers in The Diffusion of Innovations, no fundamentally new product type succeeds solely based on the fact that it’s attractive; it succeeds because it does something genuinely useful at a price point low enough that people don’t consider it a luxury. And then it becomes normal and even attractive because it was first useful.

There are 3 major functions of Wear: a Google Now-style "homescreen" with a scrollable list of cards, a rich-notification system that alerts you to information from your smartphone, and a series of contextual tools that pop up during certain activities (Call, Hangouts). All of these functions flow together when necessary, and they depend on a smartphone, if only for the data connection in some cases.

These will look a lot like the cards in the Context Stream: short snippets of relevant information, with an optional photo backdrop. Again, you'll be able to swipe to the right to see expanded information. An action button will let you perform commands on your phone without actually touching it, usually via voice, though the full capability of these actions hasn't been revealed yet.
 
Previously I have written about smartwatches and how I was unsure as to their use. I think that currently we are asking too much from them. At it’s very core, a watch is there to provide you with the time. We have many variations of watches, some offer more, quite a few can tell you the date or the day of the week, or even the current altitude.

When outside of a 10m radius of your attached phone, the watch will alert you to an incoming call, if you are unable to return to your phone to answer the call you will have an option to send a message to the caller informing them you will return their call soon.
